## Overview

Proper Vehicle Injuries (abbreviated as PVI) is a simple overhaul to the vehicle collision injury system present in Project Zomboid. The mod constantly monitors a players current and previous vehicle speed and once it observes a large change in speed, it determines a collision has occurred, dealing injuries to the player and any passengers in the vehicle.

PVI categorizes crashes into low, medium, high, and fatal to make sure crashes at different speeds feel different, while also allowing the user granular control over PVI's behaviour.

The mods core features include:
 1. **Inter-mod Support**
	- PVI supports mods such as Arendameth's [Working Seatbelts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3055029361) and [Real Knockouts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3055029361) for seatbelt and airbag functionality, vehicle ejections, and knockouts.

 2. **Helmet Protection**
	- Full-face (motorcycle helmets) and half-face (riding/bicycle/etc) helmets offer protection to head injuries.

 3. **Multiplayer Support**
	- Scripts run per-client, allowing injuries to occur much more consistently.

 4. **Horde Collisions**
	- Crashes with dense groups of zombies can now cause injuries.

 5. **Verying Severities**
	- 4 unique severity levels, allowing fine tuned customization of mod behaviour.
