description=[h1][u]Purpose[/u][/h1]
description=The name says it all! Project Zomboid does feature injuries from vehicle collisions in vanilla, however, the experience in multiplayer is extremely inconsistent. This mod aims to fix this by having each individual player determine when they were involved in a car crash and make vehicle injuries consistent for multiplayer!
description=
description=I created this mod to replace the vanilla system, along with adding additional customization so you can modify the chances of certain injuries, enable or disable the chance of breaking full limbs or even death!

description=[h1][u]Latest Update[/u][/h1]
description=[b][u]Update 3.8.1[/u][/b]
description=[list]
description=[*] Added 'Build 42' tag to PVI.

description=[h1][u]Features[/u][/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3055029361]Working Seatbelt[/url][/u][/b] support: PVI is compatible with Working Seatbelt, reducing injuries if seatbelts are buckled, airbags are installed, and potentially ejecting the player out of the vehicle!
description=
description=[*][b][u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3048123717]Real Knockouts[/url][/u][/b] support: Car crashes can now knock the player out. Knockout chance is configurable per severity level and overrides Real Knockouts chance for car crashes only.
description=
description=[*][b][u]Helmets protect your head[/u][/b]: Does what it says on the tin! Helmets offer head protection with the highest protection helmets being full-face helmets (like motorcycle helmets), and half-face helmets (riding helmets) give a lower injury reduction.
description=
description=[*][b][u]Multiplayer Support:[/u][/b] Now you can share your collision related injuries with others!
description=
description=[*][b][u]Varying Severity Levels:[/u][/b] Different speeds can cause different injuries, with different times needed to heal. The faster you go, the worse it'll be!
description=
description=[*][b][u]Zombie Hordes:[/u][/b] Trying to make a quick get away, and slam into a horde? Congratulations, because it's not just other vehicles and buildings that you can collide with!
description=
description=[*][b][u]Full Limb Fractures:[/u][/b] Makes that broken arm just that much worse, by breaking the rest of it!
description=
description=[*][b][u]Fatal Crashes:[/u][/b] Going full speed and not paying attention? Hitting a pole or other objects from full speed can very well now spell the end of your character!
description=
description=[*][b][u]Customizability:[/u][/b] Not a fan of how often certain injuries happen? Nearly all of the variables for this mod are available in the sandbox options!

description=
description=[h1][u]Planned Features[/u][/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] Minimum injuries - Currently the injury count is entirely random aside from the general body damage the player receives (this is what lowers your healthbar on collision).
description=[*] Server & Client sync - I've had several reports of laggy conditions in MP causing issues. I'm going to add a debug option and see if this helps with lag induced false positives.
description=[*] Refresh bodyParts tables when a new player is created via Events.OnCreatePlayer instead of every time a crash happens.

description=
description=If you have any other ideas that you think would be in line with the mod, feel free to add them to the "Ideas & Suggestions" discussion. These may or may not be implemented, as this mod is more meant as a small project to explore the world of modding and for me to tinker on in my spare time.

description=[h1][u]FAQ (READ BEFORE COMMENTING)[/u][/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Is PVI compatible with B42 IWBUMS?[/u][/b]
description=[/list]
description=Probably, TIS has said there were significant lua/script changes made, but PVI appears to work out of the box.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Does the load order matter when using PVI, Working Seatbelts, and Real Knockouts?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=No, according to my personal save and user reports, the load order of the three mods does not appear to matter.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Does this mod have any incompatibilities?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Since this mod doesn't replace any Zomboid files, nor modify any of the vanilla game's code, there should not be any incompatibilities with other mods.
description=
description=One thing to note however, vehicles with very high acceleration or braking power may falsely trip the collision detection, as when you speed up or stop extremely fast, it sees your high speed difference, and thinks you've crashed into something. This shouldn't be an issue for 99% of vehicles (vanilla sport's cars are not powerful enough).
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Does this mod work in SP/Coop/Dedicated MP?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Yes it works in all 3! It was built to work with MP, and because the code is handled client side, it should have no issue with either SP or Coop saves.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Is this safe to add to a current save?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Yes it is safe to add and remove at will! All of the code in the mod is custom, meaning it doesn't need to hook in to or modify any of the vanilla game code. If the mod is enabled, you'll have the injuries, if not, then you won't!
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]I'm adding this to an existing SP save, how do I change the sandbox options mid save?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Use a mod such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894296454&searchtext=change+sandbox+options]Change Sandbox Options[/url] to modify them.
description=
description=[h1][u]KNOWN ISSUES[/u][/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] Poor internet connectivity to online servers appears to cause false positives and triggers injuries. This shouldn't affect servers [u]you[/u] are hosting locally or in singleplayer.
description=[*] Check for whether vehicle has airbags or not appears to be failing for vehicles with no airbag part, causing a crash on collision detection.
description=[*] Possible compatibility issue with hotwire nerf mod, may cause immediate stop of hotwired vehicle, causing false positives for collisions.
